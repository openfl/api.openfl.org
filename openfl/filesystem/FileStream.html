Files can be opened synchronously
by calling the open() method or asynchronously by calling the openAsync() method.</p>
<p>The advantage of opening files asynchronously is that other code can execute while Adobe
AIR runs read and write processes in the background. When opened asynchronously, progress
events are dispatched as operations proceed.</p>
<p>A File object that is opened synchronously behaves much like a ByteArray object; a file
opened asynchronously behaves much like a Socket or URLStream object. When a File object
is opened synchronously, the caller pauses while the requested data is read from or written
to the underlying file. When opened asynchronously, any data written to the stream is
immediately buffered and later written to the file.</p>
<p>Whether reading from a file synchronously or asynchronously, the actual read methods are
synchronous. In both cases they read from data that is currently "available." The difference
is that when reading synchronously all of the data is available at all times, and when
reading asynchronously data becomes available gradually as the data streams into a read
buffer. Either way, the data that can be synchronously read at the current moment is
represented by the bytesAvailable property.</p>
<p>An application that is processing asynchronous input typically registers for progress events
and consumes the data as it becomes available by calling read methods. Alternatively, an
application can simply wait until all of the data is available by registering for the complete
event and processing the entire data set when the complete event is dispatched.</p><p class="javadoc">See also:</p><ul><li><div class="inline-content"><p><a href="https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/working-with-the-file-system/workflow-for-reading-and-writing-files.html">Workflow for reading and writing files</a></p></div></li><li><div class="inline-content"><p><a href="https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/working-with-the-file-system/filestream-open-modes.html">FileStream open modes</a></p></div></li><li><div class="inline-content"><p><a href="https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/working-with-the-file-system/initializing-a-filestream-object-and-opening-and-closing-files.html">Initializing a FileStream object, and opening and closing files</a></p></div></li><li><div class="inline-content"><p><a href="https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/working-with-the-file-system/the-position-property-of-a-filestream-object.html">The position property of a FileStream object</a></p></div></li><li><div class="inline-content"><p><a href="https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/working-with-the-file-system/the-read-buffer-and-the-bytesavailable-property-of-a-filestream-object.html">The read buffer and the bytesAvailable property of a FileStream object</a></p></div></li><li><div class="inline-content"><p><a href="https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/working-with-the-file-system/asynchronous-programming-and-the-events-generated-by-a-filestream-object-opened-asynchronously.html">Asynchronous programming and the events generated by a FileStream object opened asynchronously</a></p></div></li><li><div class="inline-content"><p><a href="https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/working-with-the-file-system/data-formats-and-choosing-the-read-and-write-methods-to-use.html">Data formats, and choosing the read and write methods to use</a></p></div></li><li><div class="inline-content"><p><code><a href="../../openfl/filesystem/File.html#File">openfl.filesystem.File</a></code></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 class="section">Constructor</h3><div class="fields"><div class="field "><a name="new"></a><h3 class="anchor"><code><a href="#new"><span class="identifier">new</span></a>()</code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Creates a FileStream object.

<p>This property specifies how much data an asynchronous stream attempts to read beyond the current
position. Data is read in blocks based on the file system page size. Thus if you set readAhead to
9,000 on a computer system with an 8KB (8192 byte) page size, the runtime reads ahead 2 blocks,
or 16384 bytes at a time. The default value of this property is infinity: by default a file that
is opened to read asynchronously reads as far as the end of the file.</p>
<p>Reading data from the read buffer does not change the value of the readAhead property. When you
read data from the buffer, new data is read in to refill the read buffer.</p>
<p>The readAhead property has no effect on a file that is opened synchronously.</p>
<p>As data is read in asynchronously, the FileStream object dispatches progress events. In the event
handler method for the progress event, check to see that the required number of bytes is available
(by checking the bytesAvailable property), and then read the data from the read buffer by using a
read method.</p></div></div></div><h3 class="section">Methods</h3><div class="fields"><div class="field "><a name="close"></a><h3 class="anchor"><code><a href="#close"><span class="identifier">close</span></a>():<span class="type">Void</span></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Closes the FileStream object.</p>
<p>You cannot read or write any data after you call the close() method. If the file was
opened asynchronously (the FileStream object used the openAsync() method to open the
file), calling the close() method causes the object to dispatch the close event.</p>
<p>Closing the application automatically closes all files associated with FileStream
objects in the application. However, it is best to register for a closed event on
all FileStream objects opened asynchronously that have pending data to write, before
closing the application (to ensure that data is written).</p>
<p>You can reuse the FileStream object by calling the open() or the openAsync() method.
This closes any file associated with the FileStream object, but the object does not
dispatch the close event.</p>
<p>For a FileStream object opened asynchronously (by using the openAsync() method), even
if you call the close() event for a FileStream object and delete properties and variables
that reference the object, the FileStream object is not garbage collected as long as
there are pending operations and event handlers are registered for their completion. In
particular, an otherwise unreferenced FileStream object persists as long as any of the
following are still possible:</p>
<p>For file reading operations, the end of the file has not been reached (and the complete
event has not been dispatched).
Output data is still available to written, and output-related events (such as the
outputProgress event or the ioError event) have registered event listeners.</p><p class="javadoc">Events:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>close</code></th><td><p>The file, which was opened asynchronously, is closed.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="field "><a name="open"></a><h3 class="anchor"><code><a href="#open"><span class="identifier">open</span></a>(<span style="white-space:nowrap">file:<a class="type" title="openfl.filesystem.File - A File object represents a path to a file or directory." href="../../openfl/filesystem/File.html">File</a>,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">fileMode:<a class="type" title="openfl.filesystem.FileMode - The FileMode enum defines string constants used in the fileMode parameter of the open() and openAsync() methods of the FileStream class." href="../../openfl/filesystem/FileMode.html">FileMode</a></span>):<span class="type">Void</span></code></h3><div class="doc"><p>Opens the FileStream object synchronously, pointing to the file specified by the

the listener receives notification of an event. You can register event
listeners on all nodes in the display list for a specific type of event,
phase, and priority.</p>
<p>After you successfully register an event listener, you cannot change
its priority through additional calls to <code>addEventListener()</code>.
To change a listener's priority, you must first call
<code>removeListener()</code>. Then you can register the listener again
with the new priority level.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that after the listener is registered, subsequent calls to
<code>addEventListener()</code> with a different <code>type</code> or
<code>useCapture</code> value result in the creation of a separate
listener registration. For example, if you first register a listener with
<code>useCapture</code> set to <code>true</code>, it listens only during
the capture phase. If you call <code>addEventListener()</code> again using
the same listener object, but with <code>useCapture</code> set to
<code>false</code>, you have two separate listeners: one that listens
during the capture phase and another that listens during the target and
bubbling phases.</p>
<p>You cannot register an event listener for only the target phase or the
bubbling phase. Those phases are coupled during registration because
bubbling applies only to the ancestors of the target node.</p>
<p>If you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling
<code>removeEventListener()</code>, or memory problems could result. Event
listeners are not automatically removed from memory because the garbage
collector does not remove the listener as long as the dispatching object
exists (unless the <code>useWeakReference</code> parameter is set to
<code>true</code>).</p>
<p>Copying an EventDispatcher instance does not copy the event listeners
attached to it.(If your newly created node needs an event listener, you
must attach the listener after creating the node.) However, if you move an
EventDispatcher instance, the event listeners attached to it move along
with it.</p>
<p>If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is
being processed on this node, the event listener is not triggered during
the current phase but can be triggered during a later phase in the event
flow, such as the bubbling phase.</p>
<p>If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being
processed on the node, it is still triggered by the current actions. After
it is removed, the event listener is never invoked again (unless
registered again for future processing).</p><p class="javadoc">Parameters:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><tr><th style="width:25%;"><code>type</code></th><td><p>The type of event.</p></td></tr><tr><th style="width:25%;"><code>useCapture</code></th><td><p>Determines whether the listener works in the
capture phase or the target and bubbling phases.
If <code>useCapture</code> is set to
<code>true</code>, the listener processes the
event only during the capture phase and not in the
target or bubbling phase. If
<code>useCapture</code> is <code>false</code>, the
listener processes the event only during the
target or bubbling phase. To listen for the event
in all three phases, call
<code>addEventListener</code> twice, once with
<code>useCapture</code> set to <code>true</code>,
then again with <code>useCapture</code> set to
<code>false</code>.</p></td></tr><tr><th style="width:25%;"><code>priority</code></th><td><p>The priority level of the event listener. The
priority is designated by a signed 32-bit integer.
The higher the number, the higher the priority.
All listeners with priority <em>n</em> are processed
before listeners of priority <em>n</em>-1. If two or
more listeners share the same priority, they are
processed in the order in which they were added.
The default priority is 0.</p></td></tr><tr><th style="width:25%;"><code>useWeakReference</code></th><td><p>Determines whether the reference to the listener
is strong or weak. A strong reference (the
default) prevents your listener from being
garbage-collected. A weak reference does not.</p>
<p>Class-level member functions are not subject to
garbage collection, so you can set
<code>useWeakReference</code> to <code>true</code>
for class-level member functions without
subjecting them to garbage collection. If you set
<code>useWeakReference</code> to <code>true</code>
for a listener that is a nested inner function,
the function will be garbage-collected and no
longer persistent. If you create references to the
inner function (save it in another variable) then
it is not garbage-collected and stays
persistent.</p>
<p>Weak reference support is limited to html5 and
flash/air. On other targets, this parameter is
ignored, and the reference will be strong instead.</p></td></tr></table><p class="javadoc">Throws:</p><table class="table table-bordered params"><tr class="indent"><th style="width:25%;"><code>ArgumentError</code></th><td><p>The <code>listener</code> specified is not a
