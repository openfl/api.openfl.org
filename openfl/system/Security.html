certain content settings, including settings for camera and microphone
permissions, storage quotas, and storage of persistent shared objects.
To have the SWF file use the same settings that were used in Flash
Player 6, set <code>exactSettings</code> to <code>false</code>.
In Flash Player 6, the domain used for these player settings was based
on the trailing portion of the domain of the SWF file. If the domain
of a SWF file includes more than two segments, such as
www.example.com, the first segment of the domain ("www") is removed,
and the remaining portion of the domain is used: example.com. So, in
Flash Player 6, www.example.com and store.example.com both use
example.com as the domain for these settings. Similarly,
www.example.co.uk and store.example.co.uk both use example.co.uk as
the domain for these settings. In Flash Player 7 and later, player
settings are chosen by default according to a SWF file's exact domain;
for example, a SWF file from www.example.com would use the player
settings for www.example.com, and a SWF file from store.example.com
would use the separate player settings for store.example.com.</p>
<p>When <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#exactSettings">Security.exactSettings</a></code> is set to <code>true</code>, Flash Player or AIR
uses exact domains for player settings. The default value for
<code>exactSettings</code> is <code>true</code>. If you change <code>exactSettings</code> from its
default value, do so before any events occur that require Flash Player
or AIR to choose player settings נfor example, using a camera or
microphone, or retrieving a persistent shared object.</p>
<p>If you previously published a version 6 SWF file and created
persistent shared objects from it, and you now need to retrieve those
persistent shared objects from that SWF file after porting it to
version 7 or later, or from a different SWF file of version 7 or
later, set <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#exactSettings">Security.exactSettings</a></code> to <code>false</code> before calling

in the SWF file that contains the <code>allowDomain()</code> call.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Calling this method from code in the AIR application sandbox
throws a SecurityError exception. Content outside of the application
security domain cannot directly cross-script content in the
application sandbox. However, content outside of the application
sandbox can communicate with content in the application security
sandbox using a sandbox bridge.</p>
<p>If two SWF files are served from the same domain נfor example,
http://mysite.com/swfA.swf and http://mysite.com/swfB.swf נthen
swfA.swf can examine and modify variables, objects, properties,
methods, and so on in swfB.swf, and swfB.swf can do the same for
swfA.swf. This is called <em>cross-movie scripting</em> or <em>cross-scripting</em>.</p>
<p>If two SWF files are served from different domains נfor example,
http://siteA.com/swfA.swf and http://siteB.com/siteB.swf נthen, by
default, Flash Player does not allow swfA.swf to script swfB.swf, nor
swfB.swf to script swfA.swf. A SWF file gives permission to SWF files
from other domains by calling <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code>. This is called
<em>cross-domain scripting</em>. By calling
<code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>("siteA.com")</code>, siteB.swf gives siteA.swf
permission to script it.</p>
<p>In any cross-domain situation, it is important to be clear about the
two parties involved. For the purposes of this discussion, the side
performing the cross-scripting is called the <em>accessing party</em>
(usually the accessing SWF), and the other side is called <em>the party
being accessed</em> (usually the SWF file being accessed). When siteA.swf
scripts siteB.swf, siteA.swf is the accessing party, and siteB.swf is
the party being accessed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/crossScript_load.jpg" alt="Cross-domain diagram" /></p>
<p>Cross-domain permissions that are established with <code>allowDomain()</code> are
asymmetrical. In the previous example, siteA.swf can script siteB.swf,
but siteB.swf cannot script siteA.swf, because siteA.swf has not
called <code>allowDomain()</code> to give SWF files at siteB.com permission to
script it. You can set up symmetrical permissions by having both SWF
files call <code>allowDomain()</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to protecting SWF files from cross-domain scripting
originated by other SWF files, Flash Player protects SWF files from
cross-domain scripting originated by HTML files. HTML-to-SWF scripting
can occur with older browser functions such as <code>SetVariable</code> or
callbacks established through <code><a href="../../openfl/external/ExternalInterface.html#addCallback">ExternalInterface.addCallback</a>()</code>. When
HTML-to-SWF scripting crosses domains, the SWF file being accessed
must call <code>allowDomain()</code>, just as when the accessing party is a SWF
file, or the operation will fail.</p>
<p>Specifying an IP address as a parameter to <code>allowDomain()</code> does not
permit access by all parties that originate at the specified IP
address. Instead, it permits access only by a party that contains the
specified IP address it its URL, rather than a domain name that maps
to that IP address.</p>
<p><strong>Version-specific differences</strong></p>
<p>Flash Player's cross-domain security rules have evolved from version
to version. The following table summarizes the differences.</p><table><thead><th>Latest SWF version involved in cross-scripting</th><th><code>allowDomain()</code> needed?</th><th><code>allowInsecureDomain()</code> needed?</th><th>Which SWF file must call <code>allowDomain()</code> or <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code>?</th><th>What can be specified in <code>allowDomain()</code> or <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code>?</th></thead><tbody><tr><td>5 or earlier</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Yes, if superdomains don't match</td><td>No</td><td>The SWF file being accessed, or any SWF file with the same superdomain as the SWF file being accessed</td><td><ul><li>Text-based domain (mysite.com)</li><li>IP address (192.168.1.1)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Yes, if domains don't match exactly</td><td>Yes, if performing HTTP-to-HTTPS access (even if domains match exactly)</td><td>The SWF file being accessed, or any SWF file with exactly the same domain as the SWF file being accessed</td><td><ul><li>Text-based domain (mysite.com)</li><li>IP address (192.168.1.1)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>8 or later</td><td>Yes, if domains don't match exactly</td><td>Yes, if performing HTTP-to-HTTPS access (even if domains match exactly)</td><td>SWF file being accessed</td><td><ul><li>Text-based domain (mysite.com)</li><li>IP address (192.168.1.1)</li><li>Wildcard (*)</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The versions that control the behavior of Flash Player are <em>SWF
versions</em> (the published version of a SWF file), not the version of
Flash Player itself. For example, when Flash Player 8 is playing a SWF
file published for version 7, it applies behavior that is consistent
with version 7. This practice ensures that player upgrades do not
change the behavior of <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code> in deployed SWF files.</p>
<p>The version column in the previous table shows the latest SWF version
involved in a cross-scripting operation. Flash Player determines its
behavior according to either the accessing SWF file's version or the
version of the SWF file that is being accessed, whichever is later.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs provide more detail about Flash Player
security changes involving <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Version 5</strong>. There are no cross-domain scripting restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Version 6</strong>. Cross-domain scripting security is introduced. By
default, Flash Player forbids cross-domain scripting;
<code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code> can permit it. To determine whether two files
are in the same domain, Flash Player uses each file's superdomain,
which is the exact host name from the file's URL, minus the first
segment, down to a minimum of two segments. For example, the
superdomain of www.mysite.com is mysite.com. SWF files from
www.mysite.com and store.mysite.com to script each other without a
call to <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Version 7</strong>. Superdomain matching is changed to exact domain
matching. Two files are permitted to script each other only if the
host names in their URLs are identical; otherwise, a call to
<code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code> is required. By default, files loaded from
non-HTTPS URLs are no longer permitted to script files loaded from
HTTPS URLs, even if the files are loaded from exactly the same domain.
This restriction helps protect HTTPS files, because a non-HTTPS file
is vulnerable to modification during download, and a maliciously
modified non-HTTPS file could corrupt an HTTPS file, which is
otherwise immune to such tampering. <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowInsecureDomain">Security.allowInsecureDomain</a>()</code>
is introduced to allow HTTPS SWF files that are being accessed to
voluntarily disable this restriction, but the use of
<code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowInsecureDomain">Security.allowInsecureDomain</a>()</code> is discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Version 8</strong>. There are two major areas of change:</p><ul><li>Calling <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code> now permits cross-scripting
operations only if the SWF file being accessed is the SWF file that
called <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code>. In other words, a SWF file that calls
<code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code> now permits access only to itself. In
previous versions, calling <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code> permitted
cross-scripting operations where the SWF file being accessed could be
any SWF file in the same domain as the SWF file that called
<code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code>. Calling <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code> previously
opened up the entire domain of the calling SWF file.</li><li>Support has been added for wildcard values with
<code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>("*")</code> and <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowInsecureDomain">Security.allowInsecureDomain</a>("*")</code>.
The wildcard (*) value permits cross-scripting operations where the
accessing file is any file at all, loaded from anywhere. Think of the
wildcard as a global permission. Wildcard permissions are required to
enable certain kinds of operations under the local file security
rules. Specifically, for a local SWF file with network-access
permissions to script a SWF file on the Internet, the Internet SWF
file being accessed must call <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>("*")</code>, reflecting
that the origin of a local SWF file is unknown. (If the Internet SWF
file is loaded from an HTTPS URL, the Internet SWF file must instead
call <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowInsecureDomain">Security.allowInsecureDomain</a>("*")</code>.)</li></ul>
<p>Occasionally, you may encounter the following situation: You load a
child SWF file from a different domain and want to allow the child SWF
file to script the parent SWF file, but you don't know the final
domain of the child SWF file. This can happen, for example, when you
use load-balancing redirects or third-party servers.</p>
<p>In this situation, you can use the <code>url</code> property of the URLRequest
object that you pass to <code><a href="../../openfl/display/Loader.html#load">Loader.load</a>()</code>. For example, if you load a
child SWF file into a parent SWF, you can access the
<code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of the Loader object for the parent SWF:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint haxe">Security.allowDomain(loader.contentLoaderInfo.url)</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that you wait until the child SWF file begins loading to get
the correct value of the <code>url</code> property. To determine when the child
SWF has begun loading, use the <code>progress</code> event.</p>
<p>The opposite situation can also occur; that is, you might create a
child SWF file that wants to allow its parent to script it, but
doesn't know what the domain of its parent will be. In this situation,
you can access the <code>loaderInfo</code> property of the display object that is
the SWF's root object. In the child SWF, call <code> <a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>(
this.<a href="#root">root</a>.loaderInfo.loaderURL)</code>. You don't have to wait for the
parent SWF file to load; the parent will already be loaded by the time
the child loads.</p>
<p>If you are publishing for Flash Player 8 or later, you can also handle
these situations by calling <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>("*")</code>. However,
this can sometimes be a dangerous shortcut, because it allows the
calling SWF file to be accessed by any other SWF file from any domain.
It is usually safer to use the <code>_url</code> property.</p>

and variables in the calling SWF file, which is hosted by means of the
HTTPS protocol.
Flash Player provides <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code> to maximize flexibility,
but calling this method is not recommended. Serving a file over HTTPS
provides several protections for you and your users, and calling
<code>allowInsecureDomain</code> weakens one of those protections.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Calling this method from code in the AIR application sandbox
throws a SecurityError exception. Content outside of the application
security domain cannot directly cross-script content in the
application sandbox. However, content outside of the application
sandbox can communicate with content in the application security
sandbox using a sandbox bridge.</p>
<p>This method works in the same way as <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#allowDomain">Security.allowDomain</a>()</code>, but it
also permits operations in which the accessing party is loaded with a
non-HTTPS protocol, and the party being accessed is loaded with HTTPS.
In Flash Player 7 and later, non-HTTPS files are not allowed to script
HTTPS files. The <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code> method lifts this restriction
when the HTTPS SWF file being accessed uses it.</p>
<p>Use <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code> only to enable scripting from non-HTTPS
files to HTTPS files. Use it to enable scripting when the accessing
non-HTTPS file and the HTTPS file being accessed are served from the
same domain, for example, if a SWF file at http://mysite.com wants to
script a SWF file at https://mysite.com. Do not use this method to
enable scripting between non-HTTPS files, between HTTPS files, or from
HTTPS files to non-HTTPS files. For those situations, use
<code>allowDomain()</code> instead.
The following scenario illustrates how <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code> can
compromise security, if it is not used with careful consideration.
Note that the following information is only one possible scenario,
designed to help you understand <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code> through a
real-world example of cross-scripting. It does not cover all issues
with security architecture and should be used for background
information only. The Flash Player Developer Center contains extensive
information on Flash Player and security. For more information, see

<p>Suppose you are building an e-commerce site that consists of two
components: a catalog, which does not need to be secure, because it
contains only public information; and a shopping cart/checkout
component, which must be secure to protect users' financial and
personal information. Suppose you are considering serving the catalog
from http://mysite.com/catalog.swf and the cart from
https://mysite.com/cart.swf. One requirement for your site is that a
third party should not be able to steal your users' credit card
numbers by taking advantage of a weakness in your security
architecture.</p>
<p>Suppose that a middle-party attacker intervenes between your server
and your users, attempting to steal the credit card numbers that your
users enter into your shopping cart application. A middle party might,
for example, be an unscrupulous ISP used by some of your users, or a
malicious administrator at a user's workplace נanyone who has the
ability to view or alter network packets transmitted over the public
Internet between your users and your servers. This situation is not
uncommon.</p>
<p>If cart.swf uses HTTPS to transmit credit card information to your
servers, then the middle-party attacker can't directly steal this
information from network packets, because the HTTPS transmission is
encrypted. However, the attacker can use a different technique:
altering the contents of one of your SWF files as it is delivered to
the user, replacing your SWF file with an altered version that
transmits the user's information to a different server, owned by the
attacker.</p>
<p>The HTTPS protocol, among other things, prevents this "modification"
attack from working, because, in addition to being encrypted, HTTPS
transmissions are tamper-resistant. If a middle-party attacker alters
a packet, the receiving side detects the alteration and discards the
packet. So the attacker in this situation can't alter cart.swf,
because it is delivered over HTTPS.</p>
<p>However, suppose that you want to allow buttons in catalog.swf, served
over HTTP, to add items to the shopping cart in cart.swf, served over
HTTPS. To accomplish this, cart.swf calls <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code>,
which allows catalog.swf to script cart.swf. This action has an
unintended consequence: Now the attacker can alter catalog.swf as it
is initially being downloaded by the user, because catalog.swf is
delivered with HTTP and is not tamper-resistant. The attacker's
altered catalog.swf can now script cart.swf, because cart.swf contains
a call to <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code>. The altered catalog.swf file can
use ActionScript to access the variables in cart.swf, thus reading the
user's credit card information and other sensitive data. The altered
catalog.swf can then send this data to an attacker's server.</p>
<p>Obviously, this implementation is not desired, but you still want to
allow cross-scripting between the two SWF files on your site. Here are
two possible ways to redesign this hypothetical e-commerce site to
avoid <code>allowInsecureDomain()</code>:</p><ul><li>Serve all SWF files in the application over HTTPS. This is by far
the simplest and most reliable solution. In the scenario described,
you would serve both catalog.swf and cart.swf over HTTPS. You might
experience slightly higher bandwidth consumption and server CPU load
when switching a file such as catalog.swf from HTTP to HTTPS, and your
users might experience slightly longer application load times. You
need to experiment with real servers to determine the severity of
these effects; usually they are no worse than 10-20% each, and
sometimes they are not present at all. You can usually improve results
by using HTTPS-accelerating hardware or software on your servers. A
major benefit of serving all cooperating SWF files over HTTPS is that
you can use an HTTPS URL as the main URL in the user's browser without
generating any mixed-content warnings from the browser. Also, the
browser's padlock icon becomes visible, providing your users with a
common and trusted indicator of security.</li><li>Use HTTPS-to-HTTP scripting, rather than HTTP-to-HTTPS scripting. In
the scenario described, you could store the contents of the user's
shopping cart in catalog.swf, and have cart.swf manage only the
checkout process. At checkout time, cart.swf could retrieve the cart
contents from ActionScript variables in catalog.swf. The restriction
on HTTP-to-HTTPS scripting is asymmetrical; although an HTTP-delivered
catalog.swf file cannot safely be allowed to script an HTTPS-delivered
cart.swf file, an HTTPS cart.swf file can script the HTTP catalog.swf
file. This approach is more delicate than the all-HTTPS approach; you
must be careful not to trust any SWF file delivered over HTTP, because
of its vulnerability to tampering. For example, when cart.swf
retrieves the ActionScript variable that describes the cart contents,
the ActionScript code in cart.swf cannot trust that the value of this
variable is in the format that you expect. You must verify that the
cart contents do not contain invalid data that might lead cart.swf to
take an undesired action. You must also accept the risk that a middle
party, by altering catalog.swf, could supply valid but inaccurate data
to cart.swf; for example, by placing items in the user's cart. The
usual checkout process mitigates this risk somewhat by displaying the
cart contents and total cost for final approval by the user, but the
risk remains present.</li></ul>
<p>Web browsers have enforced separation between HTTPS and non-HTTPS
files for years, and the scenario described illustrates one good
reason for this restriction. Flash Player gives you the ability to
work around this security restriction when you absolutely must, but be
sure to consider the consequences carefully before doing so.</p>

parameter. Adobe AIR and Flash Player use policy files to determine
whether to permit applications to load data from servers other than
their own. Note that even though the method name is <code>
loadPolicyFile()</code>, the file isn't actually loaded until a network
request that requires a policy file is made.
With <code><a href="../../openfl/system/Security.html#loadPolicyFile">Security.loadPolicyFile</a>()</code>, Flash Player or AIR can load policy
files from arbitrary locations, as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint haxe">Security.loadPolicyFile("http://www.example.com/sub/dir/pf.xml");</code></pre>
<p>This causes Flash Player or AIR to attempt to retrieve a policy file
from the specified URL. Any permissions granted by the policy file at
that location will apply to all content at the same level or lower in
the virtual directory hierarchy of the server.</p>
<p>For example, following the previous code, these lines do not throw an
exception:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint haxe">import openfl.net.*;

var request = new URLRequest("http://www.example.com/sub/dir/vars.txt");
var loader = new URLLoader();
loader.load(request);

var loader2 = new URLLoader();
var request2 = new URLRequest("http://www.example.com/sub/dir/deep/vars2.txt");
loader2.load(request2);</code></pre>
<p>However, the following code does throw a security exception:</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint haxe">import openfl.net.*;

var request3 = new URLRequest("http://www.example.com/elsewhere/vars3.txt");
var loader3 = new URLLoader();
loader3.load(request3);</code></pre>
<p>You can use <code>loadPolicyFile()</code> to load any number of policy files.
When considering a request that requires a policy file, Flash Player
or AIR always waits for the completion of any policy file downloads
before denying a request. As a final fallback, if no policy file
specified with <code>loadPolicyFile()</code> authorizes a request, Flash Player
or AIR consults the original default locations.</p>
<p>When checking for a master policy file, Flash Player waits three
seconds for a server response. If a response isn't received, Flash
Player assumes that no master policy file exists. However, there is no
default timeout value for calls to <code>loadPolicyFile()</code>; Flash Player
assumes that the file being called exists, and waits as long as
necessary to load it. Therefore, if you want to make sure that a
master policy file is loaded, use <code>loadPolicyFile()</code> to call it
explicitly.</p>
<p>You cannot connect to commonly reserved ports. For a complete list of
blocked ports, see "Restricting Networking APIs" in the <em>ActionScript
3.0 Developer's Guide</em>.</p>
<p>Using the <code>xmlsocket</code> protocol along with a specific port number lets
you retrieve policy files directly from an XMLSocket server, as shown
in the following example. Socket connections are not subject to the
reserved port restriction described above.</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint haxe">Security.loadPolicyFile("xmlsocket://foo.com:414");</code></pre>
<p>This causes Flash Player or AIR to attempt to retrieve a policy file
from the specified host and port. Upon establishing a connection with
the specified port, Flash Player or AIR transmits
<code>&lt;policy-file-request /&gt;</code>, terminated by a <code>null</code> byte. The server
must send a null byte to terminate a policy file, and may thereafter
close the connection; if the server does not close the connection,
Flash Player or AIR does so upon receiving the terminating <code>null</code>
byte.</p>
<p>You can prevent a SWF file from using this method by setting the
<code>allowNetworking</code> parameter of the <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> tags in the
HTML page that contains the SWF content.</p>
